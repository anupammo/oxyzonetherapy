            <p class="text-justify p-testimoni">Enter the world of your very own encyclopedia on Ozone. We know all the basics like
            that this gas protects us from the harmful cosmic rays by its unique layer formation
            above the stratosphere, we are scared when we find that there are holes formed in
            the layer. FDA (USA) recognizes Ozone as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS).
            In 1896, Nikola Tesla patented the first ozone generator in the United States.
            Ozone combined with negative ions (Bio-Oxygen) at the right concentration in air has
            been proven to be the strongest disinfectant in Mother Earth. Physicians advise that a measured dosage of ozone is necessary for inhaling
            continuously, as we drink polluted air as much as 15000 litres per day while we drink only 2 litres of water in the same time.</p>
            <h3 class="text-center">WHAT IS OZONE?</h3>
            <p class="text-justify p-testimoni">Ozone (O 3 )is an allotrope of oxygen (O 2 ) and available in nature in gaseous form. It has
            three atoms of oxygen in its molecule. Because of this third oxygen it shows distinctly different properties that come to our benefit.</p>
            <h3 class="text-center">SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLE</h3>
            <p class="text-justify p-testimoni">Ozone being a natural unstable product, Ozone produced on site automatically
            gets converted to natural oxygen only after its small life period without leaving
            any toxic by-products. Being the strongest oxidant &amp; disinfectant gifted by Mother Nature, the magic
            of this natural element is that it is also the most effective deodorizer on our
            planet. The secret of its versatile functionalities is quite simple - its extra oxygen atom
            oxidizes the hydro-carbons / R-H radicals by breaking their chemical bonds in a
            natural process, hence nullifying their properties &amp; destroying the bacterial
            cells &amp; odour creating compounds. On the top of these, they virtually increase the oxygen percentage in closed
            atmosphere where oxygen level is bound to decrease for continuous respiration
            by the inmates. That helps bringing in better productivity and quality of work and life.</p>
            <h3 class="text-center">HISTORY</h3>
            <p class="text-justify p-testimoni">Past developments in ozone applicationA Dutch chemist called Van Marum was
            probably the first person to detect ozone gas sensorially. In the description of his
            experiments, he mentioned the notion of a characteristic smell around his electrifier.
            However, the discovery of ozone was only just mentioned by name decennia later, in a
            writing of Schönbein that dates back to 1840. This discovery was presented to the
            University of München. Schönbein had noticed the same characteristc smell during his
            experiments, that Van Marum had tried to identify earlier. He called this gas &#39;ozone&#39;,
            which is distracted from ozein; the Greek word for scent. Generally, the discovery of
            ozone is ascribed to Schönbein. Moreover, Schönbein is mentioned as the first person
            to research the reaction mechanisms of ozone and organic matter.After 1840, many
            studies on the disinfection mechanism of ozone followed. The first ozone generator
            was manufactured in Berlin by Von Siemens. This manufacturer also wrote a book
            about ozone application in water. This caused a number of pilot projects to take place,
            during which the disinfection mechanism of ozone was researched.
            The French chemist Marius Paul Otto (figure 1) received a doctorate at the French
            University, for his essay on ozone. He was the first person to start a specialized
            company for the manufacture of ozone installations: &#39;Compagnie des Eaux et de
            l’Ozone&#39;.</p>
            <p class="text-justify p-testimoni">The first technical-scale application of ozone took place in Oudshoorn, Netherlands, in
            1893. This ozone installation was thouroughly studied by French sientists, and another
            unit was installed in Nice after that (in 1906). Since than, ozone was applied in Nice
            continuously, causing Nice to be called the &#39;place of birth of ozone for drinking water
            treatment&#39;.</p>
            <p class="text-justify p-testimoni">In the years prior to World War I, there was an increase in the use of ozone
            installations in various countries. Around 1916, 49 ozone installations were in use
            throughout Europe (26 of which were located in France). However, this increase
            faltered soon afterwards. This was consequential to research of toxic gases, which
            evidently lead to the development of chlorine. This disinfectant appeared to be a
            suitable alternative to ozone, as it did not have the shortcomings in management, such
            as low applicative guarantee and low yield of ozone generation. Ozone production did
            not reach its prior level until after World War II. In 1940, the number of ozone
            installations that were in use worldwide had only grown to 119. In 1977 this number,
            had increased to 1043 ozone installations. More than half of the installations were
            located in France. Around 1985, the number of applied ozone installations was
            estimated &gt;2000.</p>
            <p class="text-justify p-testimoni">Today, chlorine is still preferred over ozone for water disinfection. However, the last
            decennia the application of ozone applications did start to increase again. This was
            caused by the discovery of trihalomethanes (THM) as a harmful disinfection byproduct
            of chlorine disinfection, in 1973. Consequentially, scientists started looking for
            alternative disinfectants.
            Another problem was an increase in disturbing, difficultly removable organic
            micropollutants in surface waters. These compounds appeared to be oxidized by ozone faster than by chlorine and chlorine compounds.
            Furthermore, ozone turned out to deactivate even those microorganisms that develop resistance to disinfectants, such as Cryptosporidium.
            Finally, there has been a progress in the abolishment of shortcomings in ozone
            management.</p>
