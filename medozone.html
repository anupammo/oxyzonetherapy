            diseases are the most common cause of disability in persons under the age of 45. Spine care results in expenditures two to three time
            greater than cardiac services for many health plans. While there is no specific data related to India, spine surgeons estimate that roughly
            5% of the general population is affected by serious disc problems. Some of the main causes of back pain include facet arthropathy, sciatica,
            muscle strain, sacroilitis, bulging or herniated discs and degenerative disc disease. Prolapsed intervertebral discs (PIVD) are the most
            common cause of low back pain associated with a defined structural Abnormality. Patients who are not helped by weeks of conservative therapy
            are often referred for surgery on the premise that further non-operative care is unlikely to help. Ideally, a patient with low back pain that
            has persisted beyond a four-week period should be referred to a multidisciplinary pain centre. Different Non Surgical Interventions Employed

              The various treatment options has confused clinicians and investigators due to high failure rate and complications associated with different
              kinds of surgeries and interventions. There has been surge of interest in search of safer alternative method of decompressing the nerve roots
              maintaining the structural stability. Another safe least invasive alternative therapy that has been receiving exposure in Europe is the use of
              medical Ozone (02/03 mixture) in the treatment of PIVD. Epidural steroid injection, transforaminal epidural decompressions has a high success
              rate (up to 85%), but chances of recurrences are there specially if these interventions are done at later stage. Chemonucleolysis using
              chymopapain has also high success rate (80%) with low recurrences but not popular owing to the chances of anaphylaxis following intradiscal
              chymopapain injection. Injection of Ozone for discogenic radiculopathy (low back pain with radiation to legs) has developed as revolutionary
              alternative to chemonucleolysis and disc surgery.</p>

              <hr class="hr-left">
              <p class="text-justify p-testimoni txt-fff">Muto suggested intradiscal injection of Ozone for disc hernia in 1998 under CT guidance. Leonardi popularized
              fluoroscopy guided Ozone injection into the intervertebral disc. After that successful outcome has been reported from various European
              centers. It is very important to note from those reports that complications are remarkably few. Not a serious single life threatening
              complication was found even after 120,000 cases of Ozone nucleolysis, which stresses the safety of these procedures. The most critical portion
              of performing any of the minimally invasive procedures is accurate and safe positioning of the needle (or terminal device) in the centre of the
              disc space. The risk in ozonucleolysis is particularly minimised, with the use of a very thin 22/25-gauge needle. It may take anywhere from
              5 to 30 minutes to position a needle in the centre of the disc space under radiological guidance. Once the needle is safely placed in
              position, ozonucleolysis is completed in only another 2 to 3 minutes.</p>

            <p class="text-justify p-testimoni">Intra/intermolecular Bonds and collapse of the threedimensional Structure of the disc. The plausible mechanism
            of action is the direct effect of the ozone on the Herniation. It is well established that the nucleus pulposus (the actual part of the disc
            that herniates through annulus) is 70-90% water contained within the domain of proteoglycans. The water binding capacity of the proteoglycan
            molecule is partially a property of its size and physical shape, but the main force that holds water to the molecule stems from the ionic,
            carboxyl (COOH) and sulphate (SO4) radicals of the glycosaminoglycan chains. The ozone can have a direct effect on these carboxyl and sulphate
            groups, breaking down some of these glycosaminoglycan chains which make up the proteoglycans. The destruction of these cross-linked structures
            reduces their ability to hold water therefore diminishing the size of the herniation by dehydration of the fibrillary matrix of the nucleus
            pulposus, revealing collagen fibers and signs of regression (vacuole formation and fragmentation)- a sort of disk “mummification.”</p>

              <li>Several studies suggest disc inflammation as a mechanism of sciatica due to disc herniation. Ozone has been shown to have an effect on
              the inflammatory cascade by inhibiting synthesis of proinflammatory prostaglandins or release of bradykinin or release of algogenic
              compounds; increased release of antagonists or soluble receptors able to neutralize proinflammatory cytokines like
              interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, interferon, and tumor necrosis factor. Therefore, by reducing the inflammatory components
              there is a corresponding reduction in pain.</li>

              treatment of choice for prolapsed disc (PIVD) done under local anaesthesia in a day care setting. This procedure is ideally suited for
              cervical & lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy. Total cost of the procedure is much less than that of surgical discectomy. All
              these facts have made this procedure very popular at European countries. It is also gaining popularity in our country due to high success
              rate, less invasiveness, fewer chances of recurrences, remarkably fewer side effects meaning high safety profile, short hospital stay, no
              post operative discomfort or morbidity and low cost.</p>
