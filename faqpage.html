              According to Food & Drug Administration (FDA) of USA, Ozone is regarded as GRAS - Generally Recognised as Safe. In 1896, Nikola Tesla patented
              the first ozone generator in the United States. Ozone & negative ions (Bio-Oxygen) in the right concentration in air completely destroys aerial
              infections (bacteria, virus, fungi, etc) without disturbing the people working in the area. While we drink only 2 litres of water daily, we
              inhale a mammoth 15,000 litres of air every day. Hence doctors recommend staying in ozonized environments continuously, for breathing air free
              of aerial bacteria and rich in active oxygen.
              Test reports from Team Waterhouse show 260 CFU aerial bacteria reduced to &lt;1 (absent) in a Hospital Operation Theater & 98.67% aerial

              Nobody has been dangerously affected by Ozone till date. To achieve all purposes, it is essential to have a typical balance in quantity of
               ozone  (or concentration) and an adequate quantity of negative ions in the product gases that are distributed. The products sold in open
               market nowadays, neither produce ozone in required quantum nor has any sense of balance between ozone and negative ions. Therefore, as obvious
               result, these do not serve the above purposes at all. Most try to hide behind the excuse that Ozone may not be good for health, which is a
               blatant lie. In fact, FDA (USA) recognizes Ozone as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS). Physicians rather advise that a measured dosage of
               ozone is necessary for inhaling every time as we drink polluted air as much as 15000 litres per day while we drink only 2 litres of water in
               the same time.</p>

              Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is an allotrope of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and available in nature in gaseous form. It has three atoms of oxygen in its molecule. Because of
              this third oxygen it shows distinctly different properties that come to our benefit. Its extra oxygen atom oxidizes the hydro-carbons / R-H
              radicals by breaking their chemical bonds in a natural process, hence nullifying their properties & destroying the bacterial cells & odour
              creating compounds. On the top of these, they virtually increase the oxygen percentage in closed atmosphere where oxygen level is bound to
              decrease for continuous respiration by the inmates. That helps bringing in better productivity and quality of work and life.</p>

                What is ozone treatment for cancer?
              </blockquote>
              <p class="text-justify p-testimoni txt-black">Ozone has been shown to kill cancer cells upon contact. Cancer is caused by
              impaired / oxygen-less respiration of the body’s cells. Otto Warburg’s Nobel Prize winning discovery in 1925 changed forever what we know
              about cancer, its causes, and cures. He understood that when the body’s cells are deprived of 40% of their normal supply of oxygen, pathogenic
              changes begin to happen inside them. In Warburg’s own words: “Cancer has only one prime cause. The prime cause of cancer is the replacement of
              normal oxygen respiration of body cells by an anaerobic (oxygen-less) cell respiration.”
              That is why, late "Mr. Oxygen", Dr. Ed McCabe advised long ago to oxidize & disinfect our body with Ozone. His prescription for Ozone Therapy to
              tackle Cancer has revived lives across the globe. Lena, a 30-year old woman was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She underwent Ozone Therapy as
              a healing protocol, which includes sitting inside an ozone steam cabinet. With only her head popped out of the top, all of the pores in her
              body (except those in her head) absorb the molecules of oxygen along with their friendly molecular companion, the additional atom of oxygen
              that converts O<sub>2</sub> into O<sub>3</sub>. Following rectal insufflation of ozone, Lena expelled a dead 12-inch worm. It is unknown how
              long the worm had been living in her intestinal tract and how long it had been dead. It’s probable the worm was only recently deceased, killed
              by the ozone therapy. Worms, parasites, viruses, bacteria – all early evolutionary forms of life – thrive in low oxygen environments. By
              suffusion of ozone into the rectum and colon, in all likelihood the worm died from the duel saturation of oxygen and ozone. Ozone is the most
              powerful and rapidly-acting oxidizing agent on earth. One molecule of ozone is equal in its activity to between 3,000 to 10,000 molecules of
              chlorine. It is the best killer of harmful, pathogenic organisms. Did you know that ozone only takes 10 seconds to kill 99% of bacteria, fungi,
              yeast, mold, and viruses – 3,157 times faster than chlorine? Please visit <a href="https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/ozone-therapy-cancer-treatment">

              <blockquote>
                Why do we need ozone?
              </blockquote>
              <p class="text-justify p-testimoni txt-black">To breathe sterilized (infection-free) air & drink disinfected, deodorized & oxygenated water.</p>
              <blockquote>
                Is ozone poisonous?
              </blockquote>
              <p class="text-justify p-testimoni txt-black"> Yes, it is poisonous for poisonous compounds that harm human beings. Ozone is the strongest
              disinfectant gifted by Mother Earth. Ozone is scientifically prescribed by doctors to inhale air free of infection.</p>
              <blockquote>
                How is ozone formed in nature?
              </blockquote>
              <p class="text-justify p-testimoni txt-black">Thunder creates a high voltage situation where aerial oxygen gets converted to ozone. The fresh
              smell after rain is the smell of fresh ozone.</p>
              <blockquote>
                How does Ozone help us? Why is ozone important?
              </blockquote>
              <p class="text-justify p-testimoni txt-black">Protects us from harmful cosmic rays. Strongest disinfectant, deodorizer, oxidant gifted by Mother
              Nature. Cures Cancer. Destroys aerial infection totally. Sterilizes (makes it free of bacteria/virus/fungi/mold) and oxygenates drinking water.</p>
              <blockquote>
                Why is ozone found in the stratosphere good? Why is good ozone crucial to life on Earth? Why does Earth have an ozone layer? Why should we
                protect the ozone layer?
              </blockquote>
              <p class="text-justify p-testimoni txt-black">Earth's stratospheric ozone layer, which contains about 90 percent of the ozone in the
              atmosphere, makes the planet habitable by absorbing harmful solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation before it reaches the planet's surface.</p>
