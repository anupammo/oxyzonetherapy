              Is ozone safe? Is it safe to breathe ozone? Are ozone generators safe for humans? Are ozone air purifiers safe? Are ozone machines safe?
              What are the dangers of ozone air purifiers? Is Breathing ozone bad for you?<br />
              According to Food & Drug Administration (FDA) of USA, Ozone is regarded as GRAS - Generally Recognised as Safe. In 1896, Nikola Tesla patented
              the first ozone generator in the United States. Ozone & negative ions (Bio-Oxygen) in the right concentration in air completely destroys aerial
              infections (bacteria, virus, fungi, etc) without disturbing the people working in the area. While we drink only 2 litres of water daily, we
              inhale a mammoth 15,000 litres of air every day. Hence doctors recommend staying in ozonized environments continuously, for breathing air free
              of aerial bacteria and rich in active oxygen.
              Test reports from Team Waterhouse show 260 CFU aerial bacteria reduced to &lt;1 (absent) in a Hospital Operation Theater & 98.67% aerial
              bacteria destruction in a Food Processing company. Drop an e-mail to  office@teamwaterhouse.com to see all of their reports.
              Needless to say, nobody in the world has achieved such phenomenal technological advancement in this subject, as of yet.<br />
              Is Ozone Good or Bad?<br />
              Ozone is absolutely essential  for human health, especially in areas where sterilized atmosphere is necessary. If you care about your own
              health & well-being of your kids, use Bio Oxygen Sterilizers (https://OzonePedia.com/enclose-250/) even at homes & offices.<br />
              All packaged drinking water companies are forced to Ozonize their water before selling in market, because its only Ozone which is capable of
              complete disinfection, deodorization & increasing dissolved oxygen content in water, making it healthiest to drink.<br />
              Can the ozone be harmful to humans?<br />
              Ozone & negative ions are used in Hospitals to prevent cross-infection & maintain completely bacteria-free air.
              If Ozone concentration exceeds a certain value, it causes short-term discomforts for humans, with no proven long-term side effects.<br />
              Ozone generator health benefits / Health Effects of Ozone / How does ozone affect human health? How is ozone helpful?
              What does ozone do to the human body?<br />
              Oxidises blood
              Increases Immunity
              Prevents risk of cancer and even has proved to cure it
              Various Medical Ozone Therapies performed can be viewed in this website
              Kills aerial bacteria & increases Active Oxygen in air
              "Mr. Oxygen", Dr. Ed McCabe said Ozone is Mother Earth's greatest gift to Human Health.<br />
              Ozone generator reviews<br />
              "I recommend this product to be used in all Operation Theaters across all Hospitals in the country." - Prof. Dr. AK Gupta, SSKM Hospital.
              " I have administered Ozone Therapy in Pain Management for more than 50,000 patients in the last 6 years with 70% success rate." - Dr. GP
              Dureja, Delhi Pain Management Centre.<br />
              Can ozone kill you?<br />
              Ozone can kill your diseases, not you.<br />
              Ozone Generator Hazards<br />
              None.<br />
              The safe way to use Ozone Generators<br />
              Drop an e-mail to office@teamwaterhouse.com - the face of Global Ozone Technology.<br />
              Why is ozone dangerous?<br />
              Nobody has been dangerously affected by Ozone till date. To achieve all purposes, it is essential to have a typical balance in quantity of
               ozone  (or concentration) and an adequate quantity of negative ions in the product gases that are distributed. The products sold in open
               market nowadays, neither produce ozone in required quantum nor has any sense of balance between ozone and negative ions. Therefore, as obvious
               result, these do not serve the above purposes at all. Most try to hide behind the excuse that Ozone may not be good for health, which is a
               blatant lie. In fact, FDA (USA) recognizes Ozone as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS). Physicians rather advise that a measured dosage of
               ozone is necessary for inhaling every time as we drink polluted air as much as 15000 litres per day while we drink only 2 litres of water in
               the same time.<br />
              Problems with Ozone Generators<br />
              Cheap products in wholesale markets have no capability of producing the positive results of Ozone.<br />
              Can you smell ozone? What does ozone smell like?<br />
              Ozone has a typical fishy smell.<br />
              Does ozone kill Bacteria? Does ozone kill viruses?<br />
              Team Waterhouse has proved to completely destroy aerial bacteria and virus with Ozone & negative ions, in several Hospital Operation Theaters
              globally. <br />
              What are the side effects of too much ozone? What are the symptoms of ozone exposure? How can you tell if you are being affected
              by ozone? What does high ozone do to you?<br />
              Ozone levels above 0.1 ppm after 8 hours, causes -
              Temporary breathing difficulty
              Temporary headache
              No long-term health hazards
              Ozone levels below 0.1 ppm are used in Hospitals for complete aerial disinfection.<br />
              Can Ozone Cause Cancer?<br />
              Ozone cures Cancer. Refer to "Mr. Oxygen" , Dr. Ed McCabe.<br />
              Does ozone kill fleas?<br />
              Yes, since those are made up of principally the organic compounds Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen & Sulphur. It kills small fleas, pests or
              mosquitoes, but Ozone doesn't kill rats / lizards, etc.
              Will ozone kill mold?<br />
              Above your expectations.<br />
              How quickly does ozone dissipate?<br />
              Ozone is unstable & has a half-life of approximately 30 minutes. After that, it decomposes and breaks itself down to Oxygen.<br />
              What is ozone therapy used for?<br />
              Cardiac Dialysis
              Cancer cure
              HIV Aids treatment
              Auto-Haemo Therapy
              EDTA Chelation
              Rectal or Vaginal Insufflations
              Ozone Discolysis
              Ozone Discectomy

              Dentistry
              Anti-aging Therapy
              Opthalmology
              and lots more<br />

              Does ozone kill mycotoxins?<br />
              Only Ozone can kill mycotoxins safely with greatest efficiency.<br />
              How to  get rid of a smoke  or bad smell?<br />
              Order one https://OzonePedia.com/enclose-250/<br />
              Will ozone damage electronics?<br />
              Not at all. That is why it is preferred over all different gases and chemicals for air sterilization in Hospitals or anywhere else.<br />
              Why is ozone a problem?<br />
              Because it is the answer to major health problems.
              Ozone protects us from cosmic rays, kills aerial infections, it is the strongest treatment therapy in medical field for versatile treatments.<br />


              Why does it smell good after rain?<br />
              Thunder creates a high voltage situation where aerial oxygen gets converted to ozone. The fresh smell after rain is the smell of fresh ozone.<br />
              How does ozone sanitize?<br />
              Ozone (O3)is an allotrope of oxygen (O2) and available in nature in gaseous form. It has three atoms of oxygen in its molecule. Because of
              this third oxygen it shows distinctly different properties that come to our benefit. Its extra oxygen atom oxidizes the hydro-carbons / R-H
              radicals by breaking their chemical bonds in a natural process, hence nullifying their properties & destroying the bacterial cells & odour
              creating compounds. On the top of these, they virtually increase the oxygen percentage in closed atmosphere where oxygen level is bound to
              decrease for continuous respiration by the inmates. That helps bringing in better productivity and quality of work and life.<br />
              What happens if you breathe ozone?<br />
              You breathe air which is free of aerial infection. It is used in Hospitals by maintaining it at the right levels.<br />
              Is ozonated water safe to drink? Why is ozone used to purify water?<br />
              All packaged drinking water are Ozonated.
              Ozone is the strongest disinfectant & deodorizer gifted by Mother Nature. When you're drinking Ozonated water, you're drinking water that
              free of iron content, free of bacteria/virus/fungi/molds, free of foul odour, increased dissolved oxygen percentage.<br />
              Does ozone make you dizzy?<br />
              Its the Opposite. Test reports from Team Waterhouse show 260 CFU aerial bacteria reduced to &lt;1 (absent) in a Hospital Operation
              Theater & 98.67% aerial bacteria destruction in a Food Processing company. Hence its used in Hospitals to comfortably protect patients
              from cross-infection.
              However, cheap / unscientific products release ozone in the wrong concentrations which will cause you temporary discomfort or dizziness.
              Is ozone a carcinogen?<br />
              Ozone kills carcinogens. Ozone is used to cure Cancer.
              Is ozone cleaning safe?<br />
              Safer & recommended than any other equipment, when Ozone levels are maintained as prescribed by FDA & OSHA (USA).
              Team Waterhouse has practically proved all theoretical concepts.
              Nobody in the world has achieved such phenomenal technological advancement in this particular subject.<br />
              Is ozone therapy approved by FDA?<br />
              FDA has approved Ozone as "Generally Recognized As Safe" - GRAS.
              FDA does not directly involve in seeing how treatment is done.
              Senior medical practitioners have been practicing ozone therapy globally, with whopping success rates.
              What is ozone treatment for cancer?<br />
              Ozone has been shown to kill cancer cells upon contact.
              Cancer is caused by impaired / oxygen-less respiration of the body’s cells.
              Otto Warburg’s Nobel Prize winning discovery in 1925 changed forever what we know about cancer, its causes, and cures. He understood that
              when the body’s cells are deprived of 40% of their normal supply of oxygen, pathogenic changes begin to happen inside them.
              In Warburg’s own words: “Cancer has only one prime cause. The prime cause of cancer is the replacement of normal oxygen respiration of body cells
              by an anaerobic (oxygen-less) cell respiration.”
              That is why, late "Mr. Oxygen", Dr. Ed McCabe advised long ago to oxidize & disinfect our body with Ozone. His prescription for Ozone Therapy to
              tackle Cancer has revived lives across the globe.

              Lena, a 30-year old woman was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She underwent Ozone Therapy as a healing protocol, which includes sitting inside an
              ozone steam cabinet. With only her head popped out of the top, all of the pores in her body (except those in her head) absorb the molecules of oxygen
              along with their friendly molecular companion, the additional atom of oxygen that converts O2 into O3.
              Following rectal insufflation of ozone, Lena expelled a dead 12-inch worm. It is unknown how long the worm had been living in her intestinal tract and
              how long it had been dead. It’s probable the worm was only recently deceased, killed by the ozone therapy. Worms, parasites, viruses, bacteria – all
              early evolutionary forms of life – thrive in low oxygen environments. By suffusion of ozone into the rectum and colon, in all likelihood the worm
              died from the duel saturation of oxygen and ozone.

              Ozone is the most powerful and rapidly-acting oxidizing agent on earth. One molecule of ozone is equal in its activity to between 3,000 to 10,000
              molecules of chlorine. It is the best killer of harmful, pathogenic organisms.
              Did you know that ozone only takes 10 seconds to kill 99% of bacteria, fungi, yeast, mold, and viruses – 3,157 times faster than chlorine?<br />

              to read details about Ozone Therapy for Cancer Treatment.
              Why do we need ozone?<br />
              To breathe sterilized (infection-free) air & drink disinfected, deodorized & oxygenated water.
              Is ozone poisonous?<br />
              Yes, it is poisonous for poisonous compounds that harm human beings.
              Ozone is the strongest disinfectant gifted by Mother Earth.
              Ozone is scientifically prescribed by doctors to inhale air free of infection.
              How is ozone formed in nature?<br />
              Thunder creates a high voltage situation where aerial oxygen gets converted to ozone. The fresh smell after rain is the smell of fresh ozone.
              How does Ozone help us? Why is ozone important?<br />
              Protects us from harmful cosmic rays.
              Strongest disinfectant, deodorizer, oxidant gifted by Mother Nature.
              Cures Cancer.
              Destroys aerial infection totally.
              Sterilizes (makes it free of bacteria/virus/fungi/mold) and oxygenates drinking water.<br />
              Why is ozone found in the stratosphere good? Why is good ozone crucial to life on Earth? Why does Earth have an ozone layer?<br />
              Why should we protect the ozone layer?<br />
              Earth's stratospheric ozone layer, which contains about 90 percent of the ozone in the atmosphere, makes the planet habitable by absorbing harmful
              solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation before it reaches the planet's surface.
